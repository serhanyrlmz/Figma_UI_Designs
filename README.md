# My UI Designs in Figma
HitMeUp is a social mobile application where users can add their friends with phone numbers and make daily plans with each other. A user can activate HitMeUp mode anytime which means that user is available for new plans. Also, a user can see the list of available friends. With one tap, a user can send a notification to a friend. Nothing complicated; "Simple is better" and "Less is more".
